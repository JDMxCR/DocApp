_Embedded below is essentially the simplest Express app you can create. It is a single file app — not what you’d get if you use the Express generator, which creates the scaffolding for a full app with numerous JavaScript files, Jade templates, and sub-directories for various purposes._

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to the root URL (/) or **route**. For every other path, it will respond with a **404 Not Found**.

The example above is actually a working server: Go ahead and click on the URL shown. You’ll get a response, with real-time logs on the page, and any changes you make will be reflected in real time. This is powered by RunKit, which provides an interactive JavaScript playground connected to a complete Node environment that runs in your web browser. Below are instructions for running the same app on your local machine.

_RunKit is a third-party service not affiliated with the Express project._

#### Running Locally

First create a directory named myapp, change to it and run npm init. Then, install express as a dependency, as per the installation guide.

In the myapp directory, create a file named app.js and copy the code from the example above.

_The req (request) and res (response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can invoke req.pipe(), req.on('data', callback), and anything else you would do without Express involved._

Run the app with the following command:

<Code
  code={`
$ node app.js
`}
/>

Then, load http://localhost:3000/ in a browser to see the output.
